		<p>Are you a lady? Do you code? Are you searching for a similar bunch of ladies to discuss code with?</p>
		<p>You’ve come to the right place. We meet monthly to hear talks from leaders in the field and hack whilst developing our code-fu in the process.</p>
		<p>What if I don’t code?</p>
		<p>We are going to be discussing some pretty in-depth, geeky stuff. If you are not deterred by that and are still really excited about coming, you’re more than welcome. If you’re looking for a good place to learn to code, that’s excellent news! There are some brilliant meetups where you can work with other people who are getting started. Message us and we'll point you in the right direction.</p>
		<p>Do I have to be a lady?</p>
		<p>If you consider yourself to be a lady, we do too. If you identify as non-binary, you are more than welcome to attend. We look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
