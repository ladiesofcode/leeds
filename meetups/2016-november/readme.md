_November 29, 6:00 PM - Future Labs_

This time we had two lovely speakers who shared about their personal experiences in the industry!


### Code and Real Life - presented by [_Sorina Grave_](https://github.com/sorinagrave)

Sorina shared her story about the creation of a simple to use web app for her Gym instructor which started as a passion project but grew to become a strategy to digitise the entire organisation's structure and method of booking classes.

### Get into Tech - presented by [_Lauren Lewis_](https://twitter.com/lori_lew)

Lauren's core message during this talk was clear: You donâ€™t need to go to university, you can teach yourself. But you need help. Stay strong and postive, don't ramble.
