From Star Trek to 2001: A Space Odyssey, science fiction has inspired, leap frogged and shaped how we live today. With artificial intelligence predicted to replace jobs and change the future of work, what are the alternative futures and opportunities for humans living the science fiction future?

My talk is about software performance and my experiences with it over the years. It shows my personal view on why is performance important, how developers can ensure their code is fast and ideas for troubleshooting performance issues.

### NLP in AI: Natural Language Processing accuracy â€“ an agent prototype based on a functional linguistic theory - presented by [_Dr Kulvinder Panesar_](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/kulvinder-panesar-ph-d-6645a721)

![kulvinder_panesar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515961/35470404-dd8923a2-0340-11e8-87e9-3a17e5c4cce9.jpg)

My PhD research explores the long-standing issue within natural language processing (NLP) conversational agents (CA) of refining the accuracy of the interpretation of meaning to provide a realistic dialogue to support the human-to-computer communication. Underpinning this research, is Role and Reference Grammar (RRG), a strong, mature, functional theory, which is computationally explored to formulate the linguistic engine of a conversational software agent (CSA). How this is derived, implemented and evaluated is discussed in the talk.

_Dr Kulvinder's role as a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science, researcher and Java Programmer is supported by her strong interest in emerging technologies and advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular the cognitive dimension and conversational behaviour. Her PhD research presented an innovative approach to address the accuracy of the interpretation of meaning of what is being said, and the facilitation of a response via a linguistically centred conversational software agent (LING-CSA)._
