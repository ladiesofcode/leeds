### The Monster coming over the Hill - Enterprise Coding is Dead - presented by [_Sarah Saunders_](https://twitter.com/sasaunde)

Recently within Capgemini, we took part in an exercise to try and understand why the development community is so big on sharing knowledge, compared with other communities. The kudos you get from sharing code has a greater value to your career than the code itself. With sites like Stack Exchange, you can download every snippet of code you’ll ever need. Add this to the Open Source movement, and the growing number of products which generate code from diagrams and GUIs, and there’s a scary conclusion to be drawn:

THE CODE WE WRITE HAS NO VALUE.

So, what is it that IS of value in what we do? Through a study of “citizen integrator” projects that didn’t require any code to be written at all, I’ll try and distil the skills that underlie our job description as developers.

### Agile ADHD: wheelchair ramps for the mind - presented by [_Sally Bridgewater_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sallybridgewater/)

![sally_bridgewater_200x200](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515961/38507562-c6777404-3c14-11e8-92b5-ded8ca18ab67.jpg)

Imagine knowing you're annoying, naughty and lazy, before you're five years old. Imagine growing up with a brain that can only see about a day ahead, and beyond that your obligations always come as a dreaded surprise. This is what having ADHD is like, and without treatment, it can ruin your life.

Partly, treatment means medicine, but ADHD sufferers need to make substantial adjustments in their environment to be able to succeed. Sally Bridgewater will talk about how she's used Scrum with her fiancé Francis to provide unprecedented stability to the chaotic disorder they've both struggled to control. This story of love and patience has been called 'victorious and touching' and won the first prize at Agile Yorkshire's 2017 Christmas Lightning Talks competition.
